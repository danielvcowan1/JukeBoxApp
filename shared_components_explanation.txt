Sharing components explanation (navbar and search components):

If you look in "frontend/src/app/components/app/app.component.html", you'll see the '<navbar>' html tag, which is how we use 
the navbar component within the app component. The app component represents the root of the application, so putting 
the navbar here will make it appear in every "page" in the app.  

The other "pages" in the app are routed to via the "<router-outlet>" tag you see right below the navbar tag. 

Also, note that the navbar component is declared in the "frontend/src/app/modules/app.module.ts", which allows us to use 
it in the entire application.


As for the search component, you'll see the "<search>" html tag in the 
"frontend/src/app/components/host-layout/host-layout.component.html" markup, as well as 
the "guest-layout.component.html" markup. This is incorporating the search component within these 
two components (host-layout and guest-layout components). 

Note that the search component is declared in the "frontend/src/app/modules/shared-components.module.ts". 
This "shared-components" module is imported into "host-layout.module.ts" and "guest-layout.module.ts". 
This means that we can only use the search component within the host-layout and guest-layout components.
